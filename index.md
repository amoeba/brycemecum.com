Hi, I'm Bryce and this is my home on the web.

I'm currently working at [Columnar](https://columnar.tech) on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org), mostly on [ADBC](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc), and am a member of the Apache Arrow PMC. I was previously at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com) supporting enterprises on Arrow and more.

Before my time in the private sector, I was at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) making [software](https://github.com/nceas) and sometimes [teaching](/teaching) or giving [talks](/talks).

In my free time, I work on [TreeStats](https://treestats.net) and other stuff related to [Asheron's Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call). You can see other stuff I've worked on on my [projects](/projects) page and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amoeba) profile.  I worked in wildlife and fisheries prior to software and [still do](https://aoos.org/project/yukon-river-chinook-run-timing/).
