Hi, I'm Bryce and this is my home on the web.

I work on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com).
I used to work at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) making [software](https://github.com/nceas) and sometimes [teaching](/teaching) or giving [talks](/talks).

In my free time, I work on [TreeStats](https://treestats.net) and other stuff related to [Asheron's Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call). You can see other stuff I've worked on on my [projects](/projects) page and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amoeba) profile. I worked in fisheries prior to software and [still do](http://www.aoos.org/2019-run-timing-outlook-and-forecast-summary-chinook-salmon-yukon-river-delta/).

I tweet [@brycem](https://twitter.com/brycem) and post pictures of my dog and cats [@brycemecum](https://www.instagram.com/brycemecum/) if you're into that sort of thing.
