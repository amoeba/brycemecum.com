Hi, I'm Bryce and this is my home on the web.

I work mostly on making [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) great to work with.

I previously worked at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) making [software](https://github.com/nceas) and sometimes [teaching](/teaching) or giving [talks](/talks).

In my free time, I work on [TreeStats](https://treestats.net) and other stuff related to [Asheron's Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheron%27s_Call). You can see other stuff I've worked on on my [projects](/projects) page and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amoeba) profile. I worked in fisheries prior to software and [still do](https://aoos.org/project/yukon-river-chinook-run-timing/).
